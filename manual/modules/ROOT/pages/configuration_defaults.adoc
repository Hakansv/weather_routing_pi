= Configuration Defaults

== Weather Routing Plugin

This lists *default Configuration* settings. Hitting *Reset all Advanced* will reset the _Advanced Tab_ configuration to these default settings.

NOTE: Upoin intial installation (following the instructions), the plugin should be setup to allow the user to select any of the _Configurations_ from the Main Menu and then press _Compute_ and the routing should _Complete_  

NOTE: If you are _learning_ at this point and want to run the *Examples*, don't change the _configuration defaults_.

== Basic Tab

. All of these settings are set "out of the box" for the first _Compute_.
. Don't tough anything.

=== Start Position 

. Make Weather Route Position by right-click in Opencpn on the chart and select "Weather Route position"
. Select Start Position by selection from the dropdown.

=== Start Time

. Select Start Date & Time -User Selection
. Must within the grib file time window unless climatology is working too.
. Two options _Grib Time_ and _Current Time_

=== End Position

. Make Weather Route Position by right-click in Opencpn on the chart and select "Weather Route position"
. Select Start Position by selection from the dropdown.

=== Time Step

. Intially this is set to 12 hours to have a fast calculation.
. Select between 30 min and 12 hours.
. For routing failures first try setting this for a shorter time step.

=== Boat

. Boat.xml path  - For startup examples, select _plugins\weather_routing\boats\Boat-Climatology.xml_
. Boat.xml edit  - View and get familiar with this interface.
.. In _Boat-Climatology.xml_ 4 Sample Polar files have been added.
.. Highlight one of the Polars and select from the Tabs (Plot, Cross Over and Stats)
.. At the bottom select how to view the polar True/Apparent, etc.
.. In the Right menu select _Edit_ to see how Editing a polar works.
.. Close or Save this menu.

=== Constraints - Defaults

. Max Diverted Course 76 degrees
. Max True Wind 100 knots
. Max Apparent Wind 100 knots
. Max Swell 20 meters

=== Options - Defaults

. Time step: 1 hour 0 min 0 sec
. Detect Land: Checked (when first starting, uncheck it, requires High Res GSHHS)
. Detect Boundary: Unchecked
. Currents: Unchecked
. Optimize tacking: Unchecked

=== Data Source - Defaults

. Default Examples
.. The wind data source used for these examples is Climatology.
.. Climatology must be installed and enabled.

. For your own use
.. Download a fresh grib of the entire route area (a little
larger than then route), making sure that it is for a big enough time
interval. 
.. Then set the Grib_pi at least one frame later than the start time.
.. Grib Unchecked - You will need to check this.
.. Climatology - Leave disabled or enabled depending..
... Use Climatology alone.
... Use Climatology (30 year Noaa data averages) to extend long trip calcs both at the start and finish. 
... When data sources change there will be a color indication.
. Last Valid if Data Deficient - Uncheck. If your grib file is not long enough checking this can help.

== Advanced Tab

. Generally the default constraints work well.
. These constraints speed up calculations.
. Some adjustments may be necessary if a route does not complete.
. However first decrease _Time Step_ and increase _Max Diverted Course_

=== Constraints - Defaults

. Max Latitude: 90 degrees
. Wind vs Current: 0 (disabled) Factor for waves and hobby horsing
. Max Course Angle: 180 degrees
. Max Search Angle: 120 degrees
. Cyclones Avoid Crossing Cyclone Tracks: Unchecked  (Climatology needed)
.. within X months X  days: within 1 month 0 days

=== Options - Defaults

. Inverted Regions: Unchecked
. Integrator: Newton
. Anchoring: Unchecked
. Wind Strength: 100 percent
. Tacking Time: 0 (disabled)
. Safety Margin from land: 0 nm
. Courses Relative to True Wind: 
.. From 0 degrees to 180 degrees
.. by 5 degrees steps

If you are having trouble, set the Configuration to these defaults or
select *Configuration > Reset all Advanced*:
