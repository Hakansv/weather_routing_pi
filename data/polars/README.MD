Many thanks to Bill Freeman who has standardized and cleaned up the polar files. There are now about 700 polars to pick from.  In addition we have elaborated on the Example boats XML files that load multiple polar files and use the optimal polar file for the true wind speed (TWS) by adding notes about SailSets and sails deployed, just to show how these files can be used with your own polars that you can develop by recording using VDR_pi and using Polar_pi to make and edit the polar files.

Notes from Bill Freeman

I've removed most of the duplicate polars and tested them in weather routing under Windows.  All load without problems.  I've standardized the format and capitalization of the file names so it will be a little easier to find the polar you may be looking for.

I have standardized on a format that uses tab separated because it easier to read and spot mismatches.
I think the documentation leans toward the preferred format being semicolon separated. (We have left the format as Tab Separated because it is easier to read)
